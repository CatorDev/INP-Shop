Radeon RX 5600 XT,"The Radeon RX 5600 XT is a performance-segment graphics card by AMD, launched on January 21st, 2020. Built on the 7 nm process, and based on the Navi 10 graphics processor, in its Navi 10 XLE variant, the card supports DirectX 12. This ensures that all modern games will run on Radeon RX 5600 XT. The Navi 10 graphics processor is an average sized chip with a die area of 251 mm² and 10,300 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked Radeon RX 5700 XT, which uses the same GPU but has all 2560 shaders enabled, AMD has disabled some shading units on the Radeon RX 5600 XT to reach the product's target shader count. It features 2304 shading units, 144 texture mapping units, and 64 ROPs. AMD has paired 6 GB GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 5600 XT, which are connected using a 192-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1130 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1560 MHz, memory is running at 1500 MHz (12 Gbps effective).",1130 MHz,GDDR6,6 GB,2304,20,500.00
GeForce RTX 2060,"The GeForce RTX 2060 is a performance-segment graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on January 7th, 2019. Built on the 12 nm process, and based on the TU106 graphics processor, in its TU106-200A-KA-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 2060. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The TU106 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 445 mm² and 10,800 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked GeForce RTX 2070, which uses the same GPU but has all 2304 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce RTX 2060 to reach the product's target shader count. It features 1920 shading units, 120 texture mapping units, and 48 ROPs. Also included are 240 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 30 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 6 GB GDDR6 memory with the GeForce RTX 2060, which are connected using a 192-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1365 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1680 MHz, memory is running at 1750 MHz (14 Gbps effective).",1365,GDDR6,6 GB,1920,10,550.00
